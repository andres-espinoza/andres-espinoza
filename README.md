## Who am I? 🤔

👉🏻 I'm a 28 years old Chilean climber 🧗🏻‍♂️, cyclist 🚴🏻‍♂️ and Software Engineer at Metbus 🐱‍💻.
Currently learning more about NodeJS with Express and TypeScript 💙
   
I feel that my most important skill is my capacity to learn and adapt my self to different kind of environments and teams.    
     
I have experience doing web development, data analysis, graphic design (this GitHub banner feels good 👌), and strategic planning for companies from IT, Market Research, Retail and Financial Services Industries.
